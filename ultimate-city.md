### Residence Building

Almost everything you need is conveniently located within walking distance in the same building. Most people won't need cars. Well-lit and decorated stairwells are located at each corner of the building.

Some shops on the first floor may be noisy, so the second floor is mainly for quieter and smaller businesses, as not to possibly disturb residences on the above floors. Though, there is excellent sound-proofing for each floor and wall.

Each floor has a large 'common area' in the center for residences to mingle and workers to take breaks.

A separate 'cargo' elevator is available for shop-keepers, useful for bring goods into the store without clogging the residence elevators. These cargo elevators don't stop on residence floors.

Here's a rough outline:
